Hey, I’m Edwin — a laid-back but focused software engineer who loves solving tough problems and making things work better. I’ve always been drawn to the challenge of turning messy ideas into clean, functional code.

Before tech, I was a diesel mechanic in the Marine Corps, where I got used to fixing things under pressure and leading with precision. These days, I bring that same mindset to my work as a high school program coordinator and youth mentor. I help students figure things out — academically and personally — and it’s one of the most rewarding parts of what I do.

When I’m not deep in code or supporting students, I’m probably playing a few too many games of chess or getting way too into a board game. I like keeping a good balance between building and unwinding — always learning, always improving.

If you want to connect or swap ideas, hit me up. I’m always down to talk code, education, or games.
