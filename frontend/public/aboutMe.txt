Hello! I’m Edwin, a friendly yet introspective software engineer with a passion for transforming complex challenges into innovative solutions. My journey through the tech landscape has been anything but ordinary, driven by a commitment to excellence and a desire to push boundaries.

Before diving into software, I served as a diesel mechanic in the Marine Corps, where I honed my technical skills and learned the importance of precision and teamwork under pressure. Today, I bring that same dedication to my role as a high school as a program coordinator/ youth mentor,  where I guide students through their academic and personal journeys, helping them navigate challenges and discover their potential.

When I’m not immersed in code or counseling, you’ll find me exploring the local gaming scene strategizing over board games or diving into immersive video games. Balancing work and play is essential to me, and I’m always eager to learn and grow.

If you’re interested in connecting or exchanging ideas, feel free to reach out. Let’s innovate and inspire each other!
