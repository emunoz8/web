# Edwin MuÃ±oz ðŸ‘‹

**Engineer. Mentor. Builder of things that work.**

I specialize in building reliable, full-stack web applications using Java, Spring Boot, and React â€” with a focus on clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability.

I care deeply about writing clean code, mentoring future developers, and staying curious in a fast-moving field.

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably overthinking a chess move or sipping coffee and refining a side project.
